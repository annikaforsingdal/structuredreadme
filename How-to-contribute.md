# Contributing to Structured README

If you are a seasoned software developer adept in coding OSS, your feedback and suggestions are very welcome.  
Simply follow the usual github and Covenant [Code of Conduct].

Do not despair if have never done this before!  
If you are passionate, you can help spreading the good word across the increasingly growing non-developer digital world. There are many fellow inmates who use open source, may not have contributed yet and are willing to do so. Feel free to check out the first steps on [OSS Contribution Guidelines]. 

If you'd like to learn more about the big picture and how how OSS contributions works in general, see [How to Contribute to OSS].

In case you are looking at the first steps first, such as setting up GitHub account onwards - do visit http://www.egghead.io and read this nice post about [Egghead and more].
