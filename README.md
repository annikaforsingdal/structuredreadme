#Structured README

## Introduction

First came the software and then the README originated, mostly as an afterthought. To begin with, README was a special type of text ‘file’, among a bunch of other software files, such as executables, header files and code file, that made up a software bundle. README was intended to be a file about files, describing rather curtly, what each file contained or was meant for. The name README uses all capital letters so that most of the computers list it at the top of a directory list sorted ASCII alphabetically. Back then, none other than those who played with software would even refer to it. In today’s OSS friendly world, README has become a polite note at best, created by developers for other developers, who either want to use a new piece of software or contribute to it.
