# Git Template

Here is another example of similar approch to creating new git projects in a structured way.  A very good template that focuses on a similar structured README and more.

**git-template** contains all the essential files to make your repository useful, pretty and informative. You can copy templates, fill in your details and get back to do the things you love most - coding.
